									"Just a little note to say a BIG thanks for the recent job done at our premise.

									In April, we contracted your company to build our back deck, and recently we had your group construct a car port an fence. On both ocassions, Eddie Li visited our premise and displayed efficiency and courtesy in dealing with our many requests.

									The gentlemen who constructed our deck, car port and fence were very competent and knowledgable. Tom did a great job with the deck. Ron and Alister did a super job both in suggesting ideas and in the actual construction of the car port fence.

									We have received many compliments re the deck, car port and fence, as well as queries as to who did the job. (Hope we were able to send some business your way!) Compliments have been received from neighbours, construction people building the two houses next door, as well as the Real Estate Agent showing the new house. Once again Wayne, thanks for everything."

									"To the Owner, Manager,

									Just a note to tell you what a pleasure it has been doing business with your company because of your staff.

									From the friendly cheerful voice of Wendy (at anytime of the day) to the helpful patience and professionalism of your salesman "Eddie" right to the 2 men who worked so hard trying not to destroy my farden (which was not east because part is on a haill) Louis and Dragon did a wonderful job always in good humour and very helpful.

									We are very pleased with everything and you can count on the company name "Deck Depot" being repeated from me many times. Thanks again.

									P.S. Yes, I will do a commercial! (ha ha) "

										"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your staff for putting in our cedar fence.

										Angelo and his crew arrived at our home just as you had promised and conducted themselves in an extremely professional manner. The finished product looks absolutely beautiful. You should be extremely proud of the quality of workmanship that this crew displayed. I would not hesitate to refer your company to any of my friends or family.

										Thank you also for being so accommodating when we requested a change from our original plans. Please do not hesitate to give out our phone number to future clientele who may request a reference."

										"I understand that you are the president and owner of The Deck Depot. My name is Rohit. I live in Scaraborough and I have just recently had a deck installed by members of your organization. I am writing this letter to inform you of why I chose The Deck Depot rather than one of the many other deck installers in my area and the quality of the work performed.

										When I had originally decided to have a deck built, I phoned many deck instalers and requested quotes. Of the 15 calls I made, only about 5 installers returned the call. Of those 5, Eddie, from your company was the only one who requested a visit before making an official quote. Eddie was very responsive and came out, assessed the project and gave us a quote. One week later, I called Eddie back and he again came to my house to make the final drawings and we closed the deal. Eddie was very responsive and honest with me when negotiating the details of the project. He was open with suggestions but always respected my desires of how I wanted the deck to look.

										As scheduled, members from your company came out approximately 3 weeks later and put down the footings. In the next couple fo days, Mike came to install the deck. To my amazement, Mike worked by himself and built the entire 14x16 foot deck in approximately one and a half days. He was amazing. Despite incredible heat, Mike toiled away in the hot sun and built what has become the envy of our neighbours. Mike did a fabulous job. He nuilt a cedar deck with railings, stairs and 4 benches. If I could summarize his efforts and achievements into three words, they would be:

										Dedicated;
										Quality; and
										Professional
										I would like to thank The Deck Depot for all their hard work and a job so well done. The price that I paid for the deck was higher than the quotes I received from other installers, however the finished product was well worth the price paid. You do a high quality job wiht professional people. Great job!

										Thanks once again."

										"I just want to thank you for the job well done on my custom built deck. I specially want to thak Mike for his 'artistic' work, carefully filling in all details and making sure that nothing was missed. He not only showed that he is a great carpenter but he also showed patience by taking the time to explain to me about the procedure of building the deck. I also want to thank Eddie for giving me a very competitive price and laying out the details of the deck.

										I have received alot of compliments regarding the deck considering the deck is exposed for viewing (backing on t a Greenbelt). The deck is now the envy of the neighbourhood.

										If you require future reference please do not hesitate to call me.

										P.S. Tell Mike "Good Luck" with his new kid!"

										"As you know we recently contracted with Deck Depot for the supply and installation of a deck at our home and wish to take a moment to express our gratitude.

										Ali was the gentleman chosen to complete the work. We found Ali to be a professional. He performed his work with speed and diligence. Ali is a hard working, dedicated individual who takes great pride in his work. We found him to be a knowledgeable individual who represented Deck Depot well.

										We take great pride in our home and now we can take pride in our deck also. We are sure we will provide many years of enjoyment to our friends and family.

										We would also like to thank Eddie for his expertise in designing this beautiful deck which included not only a beautiful layout but also included a planter box and bench which add a certain flare.

										To that end, we enclose a photo of the finished deck.

										We would have no hesitation in recommending Deck Depot to our friends and neighbours.

										Thank you for your prompt and professional service."
